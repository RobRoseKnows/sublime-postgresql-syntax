## pgEdit TextMate

pgEdit is a [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle for working with
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) relational databases. It supports
PostgreSQL specific syntax coloring (e.g. dollar quoting), SQL execution,
context specific help, completion, and recognition of SQL language constructs
(tables, functions, triggers, etc.). pgEdit uses
[psql](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/app-psql.html) for
executing SQL and takes advantage of many psql features.

The online help included in the bundle is also available at

### Contributing

This bundle is implemented in PHP. Fixes and improvements are most welcome. See
